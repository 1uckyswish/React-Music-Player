# React Music Player

Welcome to the repository for my React Music Player, a full-stack application crafted from a deep dive into React JS and GraphQL. This project represents the culmination of my focused study, blending learning, application, and creation.

## Project Overview

The study aimed at mastering React JS and GraphQL, utilizing Agile methodologies and pair programming to ensure optimal efficiency and productivity. Through meticulous planning and execution, I successfully delivered two remarkable projects.
Crafted from the ground up, this full-stack application seamlessly integrates YouTube URL links or SoundCloud music links, transforming them into a cohesive music player for an enriched listening experience. ðŸŽ¶

## Technologies Used

The React Music Player, including other applications, was developed using React JS for the frontend and GraphQL for the database. The journey was demanding, requiring numerous hours of dedicated effort, but the ultimate outcomes are undeniably gratifying.
